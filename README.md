# Data-Cleaning-and-Transformation-using-Pivot-table-and-Charts-for-the-Report-on-requirement-

The objective of this project is to perform data cleaning and transformation on a dataset related to team hiring requirements, 
and present the insights through pivot tables and charts. The dataset may include various attributes such as job titles, required skills, experience, location,
and other factors that influence the hiring process.

The project will involve several stages, including data cleaning, data transformation, and data visualization. 
In the data cleaning phase, the dataset will be reviewed for inconsistencies, missing values, and any other anomalies that may affect the accuracy of the analysis. 
Data transformation will involve structuring and organizing the data to enable efficient analysis.

Once the data has been cleaned and transformed, it will be visualized using pivot tables and charts. 
The pivot tables will summarize the data by various attributes such as job titles, required skills, experience, location, and other factors. 
The charts will provide an overview of the trends and patterns in the data.

The insights gained from the analysis will be presented in a report format, highlighting the key findings and recommendations. 
The report will include the pivot tables, charts, and a narrative explaining the insights derived from the data analysis.

Overall, the project will provide a better understanding of the team hiring requirements, and help to identify areas where improvements can be made. 
It will also demonstrate the importance of data cleaning and transformation in ensuring accurate and meaningful insights.
